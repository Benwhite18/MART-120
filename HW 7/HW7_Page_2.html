             <span class="bluecolor">This is a story about a piece of artwork I did in 6th grade. The piece is made from formed PVC pipe, a funnel, some springs so the notes work, and a contruseted 
                case for the trumpet. This work got me 1st place in the junior VASE competition. I really loved working on this piece.</span>
